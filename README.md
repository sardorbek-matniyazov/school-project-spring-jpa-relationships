# school-project-spring-jpa-relationships
Hello buddy!

This project contains Spring-jpa, database relationships, hibernate, my own logics ....

I made a database based on my opinion in this project, maybe you don't like it but it seems logical true in my opinion .
I have used postgresql database driver in this project.

# The idea of Relationships is as follows

 1. You donâ€™t have to make any connections to build a school, subject .
 2. School and Subject resources will be needed to create a teacher .
 3. School and Subjects resources are required to build a class .
 4. School, Class resources are required to enter student information .
 5. Student(who was graded), teacher(who rated the student) and a subject are required to put the mark .
 
You can get acquainted with them in a wider project .

# My database's structure is as fallows
